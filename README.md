# EDA and Prediction on Body Fat Dataset

In this repo you can find a pdf concerning the work done by me and my colleague **Marco Scatassi**. 

The work is divided into two parts: an **exploratory data analysis** and a **multiple linear regression** for predicting body fat comparing different techniques and features.

The project was carried out in **R language**, using the **Kaggle** BodyFat dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset).
