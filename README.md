# Foundations of Probability and Statistics

This exam consisted of a written test and a project on the main topics of the course.

The exercise was carried out in **R language**. Together with my colleague **Marco Scatassi**, we analyzed the **Kaggle** BodyFat dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset), then we performed multiple linear regression and prediction.

Final grade: **29**.
