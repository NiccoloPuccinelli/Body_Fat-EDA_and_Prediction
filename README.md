# Foundations-of-Probability-and-Statistics

The execution of this exam included a written test and a project for the application of the main topics covered in class.

The exercise was carried out in **R language**. Together with my colleague **Marco Scatassi**, we analyzed the Kaggle BodyFat dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset), then we performed multiple linear regression and prediction.

Final grade: **29**.
